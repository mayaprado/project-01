Game **CONNECT FOUR**

[link to the game!](https://mayaprado.github.io/project-01/)

**Connect Four** is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

**Features of my game:**:video_game:

_1. This game is written for two human players;_
_2. Players take turns making moves;_
_3. There is a 7X6 grid;_
_4. There is a Play Again Button which restarts the game;_
_5. There is possibility to win/lose and also a draw condition;_
_6. There is a landing page with some text animation;_
_7. The game is accompanied by cool music._

**Challenges I overcame:**:tada:

_1. Figuring out check for win logic;_
_2. Making disks slide down the grid;_
_3. Adding animation to the landing page_

**Challenges I'm still working on:**:exclamation:

_1. Adding computer as a second player;_
_2. Adding option to log in and create an account for a player._

**Approach that I used**

To figure out the check for win logic I pseudocoded several different approaches and then tested them.
For text animation, disk sliding and sound effects I used JavaScript.
I tried to use object-oriented JavaScript coding.
